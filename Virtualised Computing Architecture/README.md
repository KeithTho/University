# Virtualised Computing Architecture

This modules assignments comprised of design work and an exam, and as such the majority of this work is not included. However, part of this module included writing benchmarks in **C** to compare different degrees of hardware virtualisation including VMs, containers and emulation. This folder contains these benchmarks

I achieved a 1st Class in this module, with a mark of 73%.
