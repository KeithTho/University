# Parallel Algorithms

While working on this module, one of the assignments involved developing my own algorithm to run in parallel as well as my own Sorting Network.

I achieved a 1st Class in this coursework, with a mark of 100% on these questions.

### Parallel Algorithm Design

>Given a set of integers between 1 and *n*, design a CRCW PRAM algorithm to decide whether there any integers repeated in the set. Full marks will be given for a correct O(1) time algorithm using *n* processors. Using an example of an input array with length 8 explains how the algorithm described would decide whether there any integers repeated in the set.

### Sorting Network Construction

>Construct a sorting network with 9 wires. If all the comparators between 3rd and 4th wires are removed from the sorting network you constructed, then prove or disprove that the resulting network is a sorting network.
