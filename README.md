### Keith Taylor
A collection of work from my bachelors degree final year in which I achieved a 1st class with 75% overall.

Each folder represents a different module completed during my degree

*Graphics and Data Visualisation* includes an application that visualises population data in the UK across different time periods using a 3D interactive map, and was programmed in Processing 4.2. 

*Parallel Algorithms* was a module focused on algorithm design on hypothetical parallel machines known as PRAM. This folder includes a copy of the algorithm I designed as well as a constructed sorting network.

*Solving Procedurally Generated Mazes* was the name of my final year project and includes the algorithm-based software that I wrote. My dissertation is available upon request.
