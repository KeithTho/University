# Solving Procedurally Generated Mazes

This folder contains all code associated with my final year project application, which simulated different algorithms within Python. A copy of my dissertation is available upon request. I achieved a 1st Class in this project, with a grade of 73/100.

### Instructions

![Picture depicting the application in use. A maze had been generated with the modified binary tree algorithm and solved using breadth-first search. It has taken 1.01 seconds to complete and searched 100% of the maze.](https://github.com/KeithTho/University/assets/102043623/aae1e5e0-604e-43a2-9733-552cc3ada9fa)

There is an executable file within the *dist*  directory. On the left of the window will be a large square in which the algorithm visualisation occurs, while the right side shows all of the available user interface. You can generate random mazes by selecting an algorithm from the **Maze Gen Algorithm** dropdown and pressing **Generate** underneath. Then you can solve this maze using various pathfinding algorithms by selecting one from the **Pathfinding Algorithm** dropdown menu and pressing the corresponding **Generate** button. Various settings below can alter the settings of both generation and visualisation, and data outputs can be found below those. 

### Dissertation

The following is an excerpt from the Abstract of my dissertation:

>Pathfinding algorithms are present in everyday technology such as video games or the route planning in google maps. Despite their ubiquity, they commonly use a mathematical language that requires familiarity and experience to fully understand. Reading algorithms in their most abstract form requires experience and familiarity, even more so if your goal is to extrapolate from the abstract and begin to understand the behaviour of an algorithm
>The program implements the binary tree and Aldous-Broder methods of maze generation as well as an algorithm developed alongside the software to create randomised mazes. The program can then implement a range of 3 different pathfinders with 7 total variations, including Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search and A*.
>The program functions as intended, accurately simulating all maze generation and pathfinding algorithms. Through the use of colour and animation it attempts to communicate algorithm behaviour to the user.
